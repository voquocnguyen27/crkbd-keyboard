# About this project
This project was created because of my love for split keyboards, my desire to try it out but I don't have the conditions to meet the price offered by the manufacturer.
# Skills
This project is based on basic knowledge of electronic circuits, micro controllers, circuit making techniques and programming skills for micro controllers.
# Tools
Schematic and PCB was created in KiCAD with the external library provided by Joe Scotto. 
He is the one who inspired me to create my own keyboard and also provided me with a lot of useful knowledge and guidance for implementing my own project.
